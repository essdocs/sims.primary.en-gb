To simplify the onboarding process for members of staff to SIMS Primary, we have added a new menu route that facilitates the sending of invitations to the staff in your school.

## Viewing members of staff not yet invited to your organisation

1. Open the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Menu" %}.
2. Use the {% include glossarytooltip.html explain="Menu Search" %} to find **Invite Staff to Your Organisation**.
3. Any members of staff not yet invited are listed in the search results.
